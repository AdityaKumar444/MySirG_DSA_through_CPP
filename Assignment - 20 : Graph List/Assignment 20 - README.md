Assignment-20: Graph List Representation

1. Define a class Graph to implement linked list representation of graph. Define needful structure for node and class for AdjList.

2. Define appropriate constructors in the classes AdjList and Graph

3. Define appropriate methods to manage linked list in AdjList

4. Define createGraph() method in Graph class to allocate memory for array of AdjList Objects.

5. Define a method addEdge() in Graph class to add a new node in adjacency list.

6. Define destructors in the classes AdjList and Graph

7. Define a method to print graph (print values of adjacency list).
